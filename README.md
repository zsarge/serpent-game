# serpent-game
This project is absolutely not related to anything trademarked. don't sue me.

With this project, I wanted to get familiar with OpenGl and CMake.
This is certianly not an innovative game concept, but it's a good place to start.

This was developed on Ubuntu. Hopefully the codebase is cross platform compatible, but I don't know yet.
