# serpent-game

This project is absolutely not related to anything trademarked. don't sue me.

With this project, I wanted to get familiar with OpenGl and CMake.
This is certianly not an innovative game concept, but it's a good place to start.

This was developed on Ubuntu. Hopefully the codebase is cross platform compatible, but I don't know yet.

The code uses the terms snake and serpent interchangably.

Todo:

- add global speed variable
- add overload operator for == in apply rules
- Make constants lowercase
- Make functions a UniformCase
- Make instruction queue
- make snake direction enum
- make snake not speed run on resize
- Add action queue
